# GAN
GAN is short of generative adversarial networks.
a GAN has 2 parts:
The **generator** learns to generate plausible data.
The **discriminator** learns to distinguish the generator's fake data from real data.

architecture of a GAN:

Both the generator and the discriminator are neural networks.
these two neural networks compete with each other by using deep learning methods to become more accurate in their predictions

you can see diffrent kind of GAN in each folder
